SANS SEC511 Wiki
==================

---

Welcome to the SANS SEC511 Wiki
----------


![Cyber Defense](SEC511/CyberDefense_logo.jpg)
### **`SEC511 Portal Version: 0.0.1 #Beta`**
### **`Course Version A13_01`**

---

The goal of the SEC511 wiki is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:
- Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**)
- Lab Intro Videos**\***
- Lab Walkthrough Videos**\***
- Course MP3s
- A Course Index (great for the GMON)
- Tool and technique cheat sheets
...and more

\*Note: Within a CPU and RAM limited VM, the videos play much better using MPlayer rather than Firefox. With mplayer just use your cursors to move forward and backward through the video. To use MPlayer: click the mouse menu button in the top left of the desktop, then highlight multimedia, and finally select GNOME MPlayer.

Or from a terminal:
```
$ mplayer /var/www/sec511-wiki/Videos/511.1_lab1_intro.mp4
```
