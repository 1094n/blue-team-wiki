Abstract
--------

The most popular IDS in the universe. Snort is free, open source, and constantly being updated. Though the IDS is free/open source, the signatures they develop in-house, Talos (formerly SourceFire VRT) Rules, are not. Different types of subscriptions exist for the Talos Rules. There are also 3rd party providers of rules that work with Snort. Most notable amongst the 3rd party providers is ET, or Emerging Threats. If freely available rules are a requirement then definitely look at the ET-Open rules.
