James Summers' Packet Analysis Spreadsheet
---------
Below you will find a link for James Summers' Packet Analysis Reference Guide. James created this many years ago when preparing for his GCIA certification. Some of you have likely encountered a version of this file. Unfortunately, many instances have removed the credits sheet up front that calls out the creator/collator of this wonderful guide.
